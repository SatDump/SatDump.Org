New Year, New SatDump! We're happy to announce a new version of SatDump with several added features and even more bug fixes.

# New Features

## NOAA APT improvements

This release brings a large number of changes to NOAA APT. One major change is that SatDump now identifies the channels you are receiving on APT. Instead of simply seeing Channel A/Channel B, you can see if each side of the transmission was Channel 1, 2, 3b, 4, or 5.

Additionally, and more importantly: NOAA APT data is now calibrated ðŸ¥³! This means APT data should match its higher-datarate callibrated cousins on HRPT, and can be used together with it in projections and data analysis. This has enabled us to add a Thermal composite, similar to what you may find in other software.

Finally, the APT Noise Reduction by Ryzerth in SDR++ has been added to SatDump! The noise removal does a good job of reducing "speckling" in your APT images when the signal is a bit weaker, without resorting to a more destructive Kuwahara filter or median blur.

## Added TIP telemetry decoder

Thanks to thomasdouwes, NOAA TIP telemetry can now be decoded from NOAA 15, 18, and 19's HRPT, DSB, and GAC downlinks. The telemetry includes a lot of internal operational data about the satellite, including one relevant piece: the AVHRR Scan Motor Current. The ability to access this information is useful in tracking the health of the motor, which has caused issues in the past with NOAA 15. Thanks Thomas!

## Added MODIS calibration

New to the calibrated data club, we welcome MODIS! Included on Aqua, Terra, the emmissive channels have been calibrated for use in data analysis. Reflective channels have not yet been calibrated, but calibration is planned for all MODIS channels.

## Added Hinode support

## Added FY-4B LRIT Support

## Auto-tracking improvements

A new work-in-progress feature has been added to the SatDump CLI: autotrack. CLI autotrack makes it easy to build an automated satellite station that can run on a Raspberry Pi or similar device. All you need to do is write a config file and start the program, and all scheduled satellite passes will be automatically recorded or decoded. To make monitoring easier, CLI autotrack makes a webpage available on http://your-ip:8081/ that shows its current status. For a full write-up, [check out this article on lego11's website](https://www.a-centauri.com/articoli/automating-satellite-reception-with-satdump-cli).

IMAGE OF THE AUTOTRACK UI

Another new feature of auto-tracking is "rotator parking," which returns your dish to a parked location until a pre-defined amount of time before the next scheduled pass.

Finally, if you used the Autotrack in the SatDump UI before: you will need to re-save the configured frequencies after updating. Once you set the frequencies again, autotracking should continue to work as normal.

## Improved Viewer Rendering

Old versions of SatDump had some issues with some image features, such as map overlay lines, "disappearing" as you zoomed out or panned around the image. This has been resolved in the new version, making for a much smoother experience when viewing satellite Data in SatDump.

Additionally, optimizations have been added to show map overlays faster after the initial render.

## Added composites

As has become a trend, Lego11 and Marhmarchi have added a numer of new composites in this version, including:

- **MCIR For METEOR:** MCIR, the beloved cloud-overlay composite, has been added for METEOR
- **Color convection longwave IR:** This enhancement uses a look-up table to better make convective phenomena stand out, such as cumulonimbus clouds.
- **Enhanced IR**: This enhancement uses a look-up table to highlight certain temperatures in the clouds. This is often presented as a product from various meteorology agencies.
- **NDWI:** a simple enhancement used to monitor changes in water content of leaves using the difference of the two channels used by this enhancement (1.61 and 0.863 Âµm).
- **CIR (Color Infrared):** TODO
- **Thunderstorm Detection:** This enhancement uses the 157 and 183 GHz channels to detect towering cumulonimbus clouds and significant thunderstorm nuclei.
- **Nighttime Fire Detection:** A work in progress, this composite uses AVHRR data to detect fires using an adaptation of the *NOCTURNAL THRESHOLD MODEL* by S. Boles and D. L. Verbyla.

Along with these additions, a number of LUTs have been replaced/updated for accuracy, and composites have been tweaked for better results. A lot of work went into this, this time around!

## Added composite descriptions

While we're talking about the viewer, we have also added descriptions for many of the RGB composites we provide in the viewer. The descriptions talk about how the composite is made, what to look for in it, and its use. It may also give you some great fun facts to tell at parties. If you do: trust us, you'll be the life of that party.

## New Documentation Website

While it's not a new feature, we have started migrating all documentation to [https://docs.satdump.org/](https://docs.satdump.org/). Here you can find a FAQ/troubleshooting page, SDR support lists, pipeline parameters, and more. It's still a work in progress, so there's more to come there!

## Other Features
- Improved detection of samplerate, frequency, and timestamp for offline decoding based on the input file name.
- Stopping a SDR with a switchable Bias-T now turns off the Bias-T power.
- Added an experimental SoapySDR plugin. It is not recommended at this time, but if you want to try it, you need to build SatDump yourself with the `-DPLUGIN_SOAPY_SDR_SUPPORT=ON` in cmake.
- Added option to mute audio in pipelines that support it, such as NOAA APT.
- Added option to remember UI size/position on screen.
- Changed FFT "Average Rate" to a more user-friendly "Average Number"
- Calibration coefficients have been added for NOAA 15 AVHRR.

# Bugs fixes

In addition to these new features, the following bugs have been fixed in 1.1.3.

## TLE Fix
About a week ago, CelesTrak removed legacy URLs to access static TLE files. SatDump was relying on one of them (active.txt) as its primary TLE source. In this release we have internally updated the URL; if you have the error shown below in an older version of SatDump, please update to resolve it.

## The last minute fix
While I was writing this changelog, one more major fix was slipped in: there was serious a bug in the DSP that resulted in poor decoding of weak QPSK signals in specific situations, such as with FengYun AHRPT, METOP AHRPT, METEOR LRPT, Landsat, and more.

## Other smaller fixes
- Fixed some bugs in using Horizons data in the tracker
- Fixed bug where floating windows could go behind the main UI
- There were a number of bugs present when running SatDump on a 32-bit platforms, including 32-Bit Raspberry Pi OS. These have been fixed.
- Fixed bug in MetOp AVHRR calibration
- Some error messages would linger in the UI for longer than they should. Error/confirmation messages now clear themselves after 5 seconds.
- Fixed a bug where the viewer would fail to load images on older graphics cards
- The "correct" option was available in the viewer for NOAA APT, which does not make sense since APT is already corrected onboard. This option has been removed.
- Fixed opening web links on Android
- Fixed "normalize" function in the viewer
- Fixed many bugs in edge cases, such as attempting to decode data at 0 SPS
- Some more bugs were fixed that are not worth mentioning... _there were so many bug fixes_

## Git log scorecard

- Total number of times we publically said "Oops": **11**
- Total number of times we forgot to save a file: **3**
- Total number of Windows-specific bugs fixed: **5**
