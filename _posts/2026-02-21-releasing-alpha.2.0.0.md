This article is more or less a follow up to [the previous one about 2.0.0](http://127.0.0.1:4000/posts/towards-2.0.0/).

# Summary

For the short version, as explained in the previous article v2.0.0 Alpha builds will start being rolled out until things are stable enough for an actual release. In the meantime, most users are encourage to switch over as v1.2.x is now officially being superseeded.  
However, do note that for some workflows, upgrading may be not an option yet (and if so, please report everything missing!). Please check before upgrading!

And now for the long version... :-)
