Uh oh, it looks like we got a little out-of-control again and changed... well, we changed a lot in SatDump. But never fear, this update contains a lot of great features that many of our users will appreciate - whether you are an amateur, or work in the professional space.

Please note, this is a major update from 1.1.4 - many internal systems have been reworked. Saved products might be arranged differently, and there are compatibility problems when mixing/matching versions of the SDR Server and SatDump GUI/CLI. As a general rule, it's a good idea to update all your systems to SatDump 1.2.0 at the same time.

Additionally, we've had some reports of issues updating to the latest build on Linux (self-built) and Windows (portable only). Windows Portable users should _not_ simply extract the .zip into their current program directory; instead, they should extract into a new directory, and copy the config folder over. Linux users should uninstall before pulling and re-building, or delete their `/usr/lib/satdump` folder and re-install.

## Fill missing Lines
TODO - Jamie

## Orbcomm STX Plotter

## TODO: Other big features

## Added composites
Nearly every team member pitched in this time around to add many great new composites - and improvements to old ones.

- **VIIRS:** Cloud Type RGB, Cloud Phase RGB, Dust/Ash RGB, Snow RGB, and Fire Temperature RGB composites have been added.
- **MERSI-LL:** added an AVHRR-equivalent 543b IR False Color composite
- **MCIR, MCIR Rain, and MSA:** these composites have been equalized to prevent being too dull or too bright, resulting in a more appealing product each time.

## Other Features
Some minor features include:
- NOAA APT: Improved noise detection and auto-crop to reduce aggressively cropped images, and improve data reliability.
- NOAA APT: SatDump will now correct pass time errors within ~15 seconds to ensure proper map overlay/projection alignment.
- METEOR LRPT: Added GUI option to disable Reed-Solomon checks, to allow for imagery reception when the satellite transmits bad codes
- Inmarsat UDP packets now contain the SatDump version if the station id is set
- UDP Source has been renamed to Network Source. It can now accept samples over nng pub/sub as well
- Added support for METEOR M2-4
- Added support for RSP1B and RSPdx-R2
- Added easy-to-use DVB-S/S2 pipelines, which can be used to demodulate signals such as the upcoming HamTV module on the ISS.
- Added the ability to set a minimum elevation to start/stop processing or recording per satellite in autotrack

# Bugs fixes
SOME PUN ABOUT BUGS

## Performance Improvements
There was a big focus this time around on performance and memory optimization. Optimizations include, but are not limited to:

- Improve map overlay performance by almost 2x
- 

## TODO: Other Big bugs

## Other smaller fixes
- METEOR LRPT: Fixed minor channel alignment bugs
- Fixed parameter conflicts with the `--port` flag in the CLI. If you used this flag anywhere, please verify the current usage with the docs.
- Fix DST bug with SatDump basebands
- Many performance/stability updates to DVB-S/S2 demodulation
- Fixed some minor USRP bugs
- Fixed bug where AMSU always saved as png
- IM-1 changes TODO: KEEP ME?
- Fixed many, many other crashes throughout the program
